# Discord Bot to search Games

This code is specifically made to search for Game downloads on various sources that have been listed on the [Megathread](https://fmhy.net).




## Installation

1. Get [Node.js v22](https://nodejs.org/dist/v22.9.0/node-v22.9.0-x64.msi)

2. Edit `config.json`, to have your Bot token and Client ID. (Doesn't require more than 1 guild but will show an error on console which can be safely ignored upon.)

3. Open Command Prompt in the corresponding folder where `Index.js` is stored and run the following:

```bash
node ./index.js
```
4. Your bot is ready to be used!

This project was born for me to research on Discord bot coding for Javascript.
